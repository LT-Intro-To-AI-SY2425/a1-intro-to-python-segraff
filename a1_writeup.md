# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

The python programming language is very efficient and I like how I don't have to add a semicolon after each line of code.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

One similarity between python and java is that both are examples of object oriented programming and you can create loops in both. One difference is the syntax. Python uses indentation, making it easier to read, while java uses curly brackets and semicolons.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

Some things that I learned through this assignment were how to slice strings in python, and how to correctly indent my code so that it doesn't have errors.
